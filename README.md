# Op-A

Op-A is a web application designed to provide an immersive and interactive experience with sound and visuals. Developed by a group of students from Politecnico di Milano as a project for Advanced Coding Tools And Methodologies, Op-A utilizes MIDI signals to generate sound and control visual elements on screen.

## Overview

Op-A is structured into three distinct sections:

1. **MIDI Transformer:** This section allows users to manipulate MIDI signals received from external devices. Users can adjust the key and mode of the notes to create unique musical compositions.

2. **Effects:** The Effects section offers a range of audio effects that users can apply to modify the sound of the notes generated by the MIDI Transformer. These effects include reverb, distortion, chorus, and flanger, providing users with versatile options for sound manipulation.

3. **Arpeggiator:** The Arpeggiator is a central feature of Op-A, inspired by the "tombola" function of the OP-1 synthesizer. In this section, users can create complex rhythmic patterns by combining different notes and controlling the speed and direction of the arpeggio. The "tombola" function on the OP-1 synthesizer is a unique feature that randomly selects notes from a pool of possibilities, creating unpredictable and evolving musical sequences. Similarly, the Arpeggiator in Op-A allows users to experiment with randomness and spontaneity in their compositions, adding an element of surprise and creativity to their musical explorations.

## Features

- Seamless integration with external MIDI controllers for a more immersive experience.
- Mouse controls are available for users who do not have access to external MIDI devices.
- Intuitive user interface designed for ease of use and exploration.
- Dynamic visual elements complement the audio experience, enhancing engagement and creativity.

## Compatibility

Op-A has been tested on Chrome version 123.0.6312.106 (Official Build) (64-bit) for CSS compatibility.

## Getting Started

To get started with Op-A, simply clone the repository and open the index.html file in your preferred web browser. Connect an external MIDI controller for optimal functionality, or use the keyboard controls provided within the application to begin exploring the different features.
